# CompIII_Lab
lab 1 we got to introduce ourselfs and got a look at the first lab. We first looked at the jobs of each member and we each decided who is doing what for their job. We then split the code into 4 parts for each member in the group and decide what platform we are going to share code on to submit one final code at the end. One memnber did the output, another member did the input and the other 2 members done the math and the calculations for the final result.
